// Data Type
alert("Hello!")
// this just throws a quick greeting

// you can do lot more with JavaScript string
// there is indexing
var name = "Rupesh"
var lastName = "Mudavath"
// JavaScript uses camel case

console.log(name[4]);
//gives fourth index starting from zero
console.log("Strings can vbe cancatinated as "+"this")
// Undefined
// any thing that does not have a value or not defined are Undefined
var temp;
var see = NaN;
console.log("all the above are "+typeof(temp));

var temp = false
// it also has type Boolean


// Operators

true == true
// comparison
"2" == 2
// gives true but string not equals to number
// so we want
"2" === 2
// return false

// to get power of a number we use
4 ** 3

// except this all the other operators are same as of any other programming language
console.log("you are cool!");
