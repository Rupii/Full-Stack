var name = "Rupesh"
var lastName = "Mudavath"
var age = 30
console.log(name+" "+lastName)
console.log("Age of "+name+" is "+age)

console.log("Data type of name is "+typeof(name)+" \n Data type of age is "+typeof(age))

// here you can see the data types of both name and age are different
// But we mentioned both as var
// This is chosen by JavaScript{ dynamically typed}
